# Zomato Scholarships - Web Development Technical Challenge

## About

Welcome to your technical challlenge! :star2:
In your challenge, you will be given a task and will have to find a correct way to represent it through code.
For this technical challenge you should use the material which was previously sent for preparation - Along with any additional preparation of your one! Remember, only the best ones will persevere :muscle:

## Getting Started

Make sure you registered on [Repl.it](https://repl.it), and then logged in:bust_in_silhouette:
This is the online coding platform you will use to write your code - Which the Ta's will later review with you.

### Requirements

:heavy_exclamation_mark:You are not supposed to copy your answers from Google. In fact, even though Google is generally our friend, for this challenge we expect you to figure things out on your own.
We are testing you on your abillity to solve problems and absorb knowledge - So, you should be based on the material sent by Ironhack.

## The Challenge

You will be given a set of questions, or iterations, which you should code on Javascript.

:no_entry:You are NOT supposed to write different blocks per number of questions - you should apply every answer on the same block of code, incrementally.

:heavy_check_mark:You can/should leave comments in the middle so that it will be easier to explain your logical thinking to the TA's.

### Your Tasks :eyes:

- [ ] Open [this replIt file](https://repl.it/@GTCarmona/Scholarships) and start writing on it. It will become "yours".

- [ ] Print to the console a list of numbers from 1 to 100

- [ ] For all numbers that are divisible by 3, you must print "Iron" to the console instead of the number

- [ ] For all numbers that are numbers divisible by 5, you must print "Hack" to the console instead of the number

- [ ] For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print Ironhack

- [ ] Skip all numbers divisible by 7

- [ ] For numbers divisible by 10 or 16, you must print “WebDev”

- [ ] Change the list order and print out the numbers from 100 to 1

- [ ] When a number is not divisible by 2 and the previous number is divisible by 10, you must print "Bootcamp"

- [ ] Adapt the code into a function that receives a number as an argument. That number will correspond to the length of the list, and call that function once is defined

## Resources

You can check the materials which were sent [here](http://materials.ironhack.com/s/ByPc-nAjl).

## Reporting issues

The Teaching Assistants will be there to supervise. :point_right: They cannot answer any questions about javascript, or help you with your code.
:runner:Go to them once you're done with the exercise and you can explain the decisions you made.

# Good luck!! :raised_hands:
